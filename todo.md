# TODO

**when working with this doc re-read it after doing compaction/summary and after significant changes**
**after making changes do not commit, review code-quality.md and review the changes for quality issues**
**after making changes do not commit until the user tests**

Review applet-tools.md and the applet_howto tool text.  Are we covering all APIs?  Shell API is not covered.  Check API.md and consolidate.

Review all MCP tools in #api.md and ensure all are covered.  Create a review of agent ability to introspect the environment through tools.  We may want to have a caco_howto tool that tells to look at API.md to discover all HTTP APIs, or add http_api_docs tool?

Do we have too many internal tools?  Do the tool descriptions clog context for weaker models?

eventually want to combine schedule and session-list.  Currently jobs applet is schedule UI.  User needs to use it more.

# every so often

Code quality pass with clean Opus agent using code-quality.md

Dead code pass (knip is not perfect)

useless unit test pass
