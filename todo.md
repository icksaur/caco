# TODO

**when working with this doc re-read it after doing compaction/summary and after significant changes**

API review.  Find all routes and compare to API.md and update API.md.  Document all HTTP API JSON payload formats.  API.md

API consolidation - read API.md and find opportunities for consolidation.  We have many HTTP routes and perhaps some of them can be combined to simplify our API surface area and thus code.

investigate how git front-ends work.  Make case study for git status applet.  Consider streaming to applet changes or what applet functionality is required.
