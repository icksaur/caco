# things to do

MPC wrapper for applet or JS use
make a doc: mcp-wrapper.md
Do research on MCP protocol
STDIO, HTTP, etc are not not complex.
consider leaving SSE out of scope if it's complex.
Goal: Once an agent figures out how to solve a problem, it can write an applet that solves the same problem using the same MCP tools with simple API.

we have a TON of TS interfaces.  What are those?  Like structs?  I see some are defined and used in only one function.  Can we find dead code? Maybe I'm misunderstanding TS (I am a C++/C# developer)
