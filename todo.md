# TODO

**when working with this doc re-read it after doing compaction/summary and after significant changes**
**after making changes do not commit, review code-quality.md and review the changes for quality issues**
**after making changes do not commit until the user tests**

Applet view widening.  Either a button (only in applet div) to expand to full-window, a draggable separator, or something else.  Not an issue on Mobile, applets fill the limited space whenever open.  Review our view-controller.ts and index.html and suggest options.  We should spec this in applet.md

Review vision.md.  Create doodle applet with button to send sketch to prompt using image paste UI and code.  Ensure caco agents can read doodle image data.  See applet.md for considerations to the communication method.

Better UI for jobs.  Applet is untested and not integrated.  Should be doable without applets.  What would be a simple way to schedule?

Code quality pass with clean Opus agent using code-quality.md

Dead code pass (knip is not perfect)
