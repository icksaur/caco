# code quality

The purpose of code quality is:
1. correctness
2. maintainability

Correctness means code that does what we want.
With good code quality, it is cheaper and easier to create correct code and avoid defects.
Maintainabillity means it's easy to add new features and easier to fix defects (bugs).

## worst

complexity - the greatest enemy!
coupling - source of complexity!
wrong abstraction - extremely expensive!

## bad

global state
unnecessary abstraction
side effects
mutable objects
huge comments

## good

separation of concerns
encapsulation over inheritance
let runtime do branches via polymorphism
functional procedures
enforced valid classes
only one way to do one thing
descriptive data
data driven behavior
descriptive names
immutable objects
consistent naming
