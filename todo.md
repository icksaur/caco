# TODO

**when working with this doc re-read it after doing compaction/summary and after significant changes**

Increase session list fidelity.  Investigate adding more clarity: session is "active" in that it's currently non-idle in SDK.  Put the little spinning throbber there when sessions are active.  I think we have that in the HTML or DOM.  It was a previous feature which hid the delete button.  Sessions in that state cannot be deleted.  Deletion via API should result in a 40x (400 I think).
