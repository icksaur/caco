# TODO

**when working with this doc re-read it after doing compaction/summary and after significant changes**
**after making changes do not commit, review code-quality.md and review the changes for quality issues**
**after making changes do not commit until the user tests**

Add syntax highlighting to text-editor applet.  I think we have syntax highlighting but it might be for markdown.  Look into options online, github, etc.  If we need a new one, please choose a simple and performant one that handles these programming languages (lua C++ typescript css bash C# powershell markdown)  Markdown doesn't need to render, just highlight.

# every so often

Code quality pass with clean Opus agent using code-quality.md
