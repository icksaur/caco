# TODO

**when working with this doc re-read it after doing compaction/summary and after significant changes**
**after making changes do not commit, review code-quality.md and review the changes for quality issues**
**after making changes do not commit until the user tests**

fuzzy-find session description:
work in session-ux.md
Session panel puts user input in text input, which fuzzy finds sessions so minimize keypress

keyboard input:
keyboard shortcuts for major actions:
toggle session panel
toggle applet panel
expand applet panel


out-of-band agent input:
Inject content into a busy agent session.  Something that causes it to change course without interrupting the "premium request" due to outside influence, similar to stop or permission requests, but automated via arbitrary external factors.

Applet-to-agent efficiency:
review docs for applet-to-agent two-way communication, and ensure they are up-to date
gain complete understanding of current communication method
analyze alternative communication patterns for reliability, simplicity, or speed

Review vision.md.  Create doodle applet with button to send sketch to prompt using image paste UI and code.  Ensure caco agents can read doodle image data.  See applet.md for considerations to the communication method.

# every so often

Code quality pass with clean Opus agent using code-quality.md

Dead code pass (knip is not perfect)

useless unit test pass
