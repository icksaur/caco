# things to do

API review.  Find all routes and compare to API.md and update API.md.  Document all HTTP API JSON payload formats.

API consolidation - read API.md and find redundant or simplification when things can either be generalized.  We have many HTTP routes and perhaps some of them can be combined to provide the same behavior surface area.
