# TODO

**when working with this doc re-read it after doing compaction/summary and after significant changes**
**after making changes do not commit, review code-quality.md and review the changes for quality issues**
**after making changes do not commit until the user tests**

Provide easy access to applet browser.  One idea - always show applet button (we hide it now if no applets).  Click and hold for one second or long press on touch can navigate to applet-browser.
Would require some changes in view-controller.ts and perhaps app-state.ts.  Investigate if this is straightforward.
Reqirements:
easy access to applet-browser on desktop and mobile
maintain iOS/mobile screen real estate (avoid more buttons)

# every so often

Code quality pass with clean Opus agent using code-quality.md

Dead code pass (knip is not perfect)

useless unit test pass
