# things to do

Fix set_applet_state in calculator.
agent get -> set -> get flow works in agent (state is found on server)
applet is not getting the SET, or not updating the state in its UI

app-to-session vision flow:
apps can send image data to agent when making requests
agents can get image data from apps (maybe already works?)

agent-to-agent recursion or loop defense
server-side, like failure for  agent-to-agent MCP tools or POST endpoint protection

MPC wrapper for apps
Once an agent figures out how to solve a problem, it can write an applet that solves the same problem using the same MCP tools.
