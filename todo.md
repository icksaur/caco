# TODO

review unit tests for low-value or brittle tests

code coverage report possible to identify areas of opportunity in #code-quality.md ?

Scan for secrets and personal information/local paths, privacy review (any package for this?)  My name is in the commits and I guess that's fine.

# every so often

Code quality pass with clean Opus agent using code-quality.md

Dead code pass (knip is not perfect)

review unit tests for low-value or brittle tests
